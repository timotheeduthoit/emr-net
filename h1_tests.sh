# 1. Start the Hyperledger Fabric network with certificate authorities for Org1, Org2, and Orderer Org:
#    - Execute: ./network.sh up -ca -c emrchannel -s couchdb
#    - This command also creates the "emrchannel" by default.

# 2. Verify the channel creation:
#    - Confirm that the emrchannel has been created and that the organizations are joined to it.

# 3. Deploy the "emrChaincode" to the channel:
#    - Run: ./network.sh deployCC -ccn emr -ccp ./chaincode -ccl go -c emrchannel
#    - Wait for successful chaincode packaging, installing, approving, and committing.

# 4. Validate the deployment:
#    - Check Docker containers with docker ps -a to verify that peers, orderer, and CA services are running.
#    - Confirm the chaincode commit by querying the channelâ€™s chaincode definition or logs.

# 5. List all relevant identities:
#    - Identify hospital1 and hospital2 users in org1 with the "hospital" role.
#    - Identify patient1 and patient2 users in org2 with the "patient" role.
#    - Ensure that admin users for each organization and peer identities are all enrolled.

# 6. Troubleshoot common issues:
#    - If enrollment errors appear, re-run registerEnroll.sh or fix configurations in Fabric-CA.
#    - If chaincode install fails, review logs for error messages, check Go version/dependencies, and re-try the deployment steps.

# Setup env for peer1.org2 and join channel
